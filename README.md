# Pylos

Pylos is a strategic 2-player board game.

More info at http://en.gigamic.com/game/pylos.

This project's main goal is to build an AI for playing pylos for educational purposes.
Secondary goals:
 - Build a nice web front-end (perhaps using http://boardgame.io)
 - Build a nice app
 - implement an optimal minimax strategy

Implementation for the AI can be found under python/
